# API_Testing_simple

This project's goal is to show the basic knowledge and skill in POSTMAN for API Testing (manual)  
The scenario: (With the supported platform and data from a free platform), 
I'm processing the API test in POSTMAN for 4 main features: Register, Login, User's list view - User's information searching, Delete User

This simple project does not contain Integrated API Testing (Flow testing) due to not a real-problem project, only Unit Test for each feature  
The log bug info is in the same file test (sheet: Log bug) with the standard format
